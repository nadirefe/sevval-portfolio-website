## GRADUATION PROJECT

***Project Title*: Interactive Visualization of Human Flows and
Movement**

Project aims to visualize human flows and movement in Sabancı University using a map. Project mainly focuses on two problems: Visualization and classification of the student trajectories. In our project, we used router connection-based movement. Our data is from Sabanci University campus which was captured between November 2015 and February 2016. Technologies such as React.js and JavaScript were used in the graphical user interface side of the project and Python, Node.js, was used to process data, generate data, generate heatmap and classify trajectories.

Visualizing trajectories allows us to analyse movement patterns within Sabancı University campus. Those movement pattern analyses provide us useful information such as the hourly population density of buildings and areas in the Sabancı University. This information may allow commerce or student clubs to maximize student engagement by doing their events in such areas. Besides the commercial benefit of this information the trajectory results can provide with the changes in behaviours of a student such as attendance ratios to the classes, library or sports center usage within students and cafe preferences among the residents. 

Unsupervised learning is planned to be used in classification using machine learning. We are planning to use and combine many models such as k-means and decision trees. Individual trajectories are aimed to be classified as such: Dorm student, non-dorm students, professors, staff members, etc. Classification of the trajectories will be shown using different colors according to their trajectory class in the web interface.
