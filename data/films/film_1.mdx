## **Close Reading on the Opening Sequence of Cleo de 5 à 7**

After the post-war years, the feeling or desire of freedom, which started to be felt with the power of intense rebellion and idealism, began to be effective in life. Art started to take shape in this direction. “Nouvelle Vague – French New Wave”, which emerged in France in the late 1950s, took one of the biggest steps to create a modern cinema perception under these emotions. It had created the concept of "modern cinema". This also supported the existentialism movement and the idea “cinema is art” started to strengthen. Known today as the “grandmother of the new wave trend”, Agnes Varda is the only woman in this trend, she is also a feminist and reflects this in her films. After her film “La Pointe Courte” which is one of the first films in new wave, “Cleo de 5 à 7” appeared in 1962.

Agnès Varda, with Cleo from 5 to 7, reflects a real-time portrait of a singer named Florence, ‘Cléo’ who is waiting for biopsy results, drifting in Paris in the 60s. The film opens with the singer's visit to a tarot fortune teller. We witness Cléo, who learns that the prophecies about her are not positive, at the beginning of a summer evening on the streets of Paris, and her waiting. In this film, Varda develops discourses on the difference between measurable time and 'heterogeneous' time that people feel. Following Cléo throughout the movie, Varda observes her character awaiting the results. Cléo is a beautiful, confident Parisian pop star and she spends between 5 pm and 7 pm of her daily activities. The 90-minute duration of the movie indicates that the time flow for Cléo really accelerates, and the time her feels and perceiving of life begin to increase. Among all this waiting, Varda also addresses the key topics of that time: fear of cancer, the Algerian war, feminist empowerment. She organized her film with a narrative structure. There is an experimental style in matching running time and the screen time. Varda recorded life as it is in an episodic structure. She also examined the question “What happens a woman appears in a public sphere of the city?”. We together searching for it by following “the Flàneuse”, Cleo.

Film’s opening sequence is composed of the prologue and the complete first chapter. In the first scene, we see Cleo is in a fortune teller’s table. This scene offers a glimpse of many things in Cléo's life; her career, lover, friends. It was shot in color, different from the rest of the movie. In this scene, taken from the top of the table of a fortune teller, in which two pairs of hands are moved, we hear the sounds from the screen. The fortune teller tells Cléo to choose nine cards. These cards spread in three rows; Three for the past, three for the present and three for the future. We have the opportunity to examine the cards from close-up, almost all the characters we will encounter in the movie are shown here roughly through the cards. The fortune teller has a fair share in her determinations: Cléo is a talented musician, she has a strong woman being in her life, her assistant Angèle, and a generous lover who helps her career. The fortune teller reads a second deck in which Cléo can see her destiny more clearly because she does not see the cards on the floor sufficient. Having stated that she predicts a serious illness, the camera passes into the faces of the actresses and we notice that the film will actually be in black and white. Close-up shooting was used in the scenes where we watch the actresses at the table. Here we move on to Cléo's first emotional expression: a combination of fear and sadness.

Varda starts switching between black and white shots of women and colored shots of cards. Card designs match the motifs of the tablecloth, it is director’s signature move. As Varda explains, “Prologue fortune tellers take place in a traditional, classic interior filled with small objects, clocks and more. I wanted to make a very violent series that faced the contrast of the movie. ". The credit portion of the movie is located on the left and right of the screen, behind the tarot cards. It has blocky and white typography. After the credit segment, the fortune teller opens a new card to talk about Cleo's disease. The fortune teller tries to calm Cléo, who chose the death card, by saying that this does not mean absolute death, symbolizing a transformation in her life. But Cléo has already convinced herself that death is soon. She also asks the fortune teller to read her palm. Looking at the young woman's hand, the fortune teller lies to her, claiming that she cannot read palms. The fortune teller who broke the cards after Cléo leaving the place tells her friend that she has seen cancer in Cleo’s future.

Along with the representation of real life in black and white, the tarot cards’ coloredness is an allegory. What the fortune teller said to Cléo was not as well-based as it really was, it was a more superficial analysis. So the prologue draws a somewhat wrong picture, exaggerating Cléo's fate, at the same time lacking feelings and emotionality. Varda turns color images into reality to show the complexity of the essence of life.

Chapter 1 begins when Cleo leaves the fortune teller. We watch the character, who is about to leave the building, descend from the stairs, at this moment music enters; "Cleo" from Pharmakos. Music creates a slightly dramatic, tense and melancholic atmosphere. While she walks down the staircase, the action is captured in a series of three jump cuts in a close shot. That visible editing and the time in the movie is an example of the transformation from motion-image to time-image that Gilles Deleuze placed at the foundation of the transition from classical cinema to modern cinema. The film of director Agnès Varda not centers the action, but centers inaction, wandering, waiting and time. Just before going out to the street, we watch Cleo in a close-up shot, in front of the mirror, while convincing herself that she will live as long as she is beautiful. The mirror is a very important object here. While Cleo sees only her beauty in front of the mirror, we observe that when she sees her reflection in a broken glass after the opening sequence, she associates herself with death.

Then we watch Cleo from far away while walking the streets of Paris to meet Angela. Director Varda's camera also follows every step of Cléo, reflecting the vivid picture of Paris, which can said as dynamic shot. The bustle of the city and the rhythm of daily life are sometimes a symbol of Cléo's emotional confusion, which awaits news that can change the course of her life, and sometimes contrasts with the mess in her mind. When Cleo finally comes to the cafe and meets with Angela, we see that her fear of death is actually very deep, although it seemed spoiled by people around her. This acceptance informs that in the continuation of the movie, she will question existence, the course of her life and her identity that others made her to build. The first attempt on introducing of city is significant, since city is where she recovers, where we see her as a flàneuse.

General aura of the opening sequence gives a sense of despair. Also external and internal realities in the subtext creates a suspenseful and ambiguous mood. We see the features of Cleo had before this interrogation phase are superstition, coquettishness and exaggerated feminity. As the movie continues, introspection will replace what we initially see as arrogance. She drew her strength from her beauty, but time will make her figure out she is insecure and fearful inside. The film in film scene, one with Anna Karina and Jean Luc Godard, is besides being saluting Varda’s friends, it was an another allegory for anxiety of being seen and not being able to seeing the truth at the same time.
