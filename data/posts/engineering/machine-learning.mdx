## MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

**Analyze education/job data about Kagglers**

Data is collected about Kaggle competition participants which is given to analyze, study and draw insights from.

It is asked to build a machine learning model for predicting a given target variable.

*Completed tasks:*

•In the visualization and insight task, data is analyzed and insights are drawed that may be used for a new business.

•With visualizations, important aspects of the data and insights that may suggest business value/potential are summarized (e.g. what courses people are taking may be used to design new course material or to see where they can find more data scientists).

•In the prediction task (organized as a Kaggle competition), the JobSatisfaction of a Kaggler is tried to predicted, given their job description, level etc.

•Preprocessing and feature selection/extraction are included. It is highlighted which features emerged as most important.

•The methods/algorithms tried are showed.

•System performance is analyzed.
