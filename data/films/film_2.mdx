## **La Haine**

With the invention of motion picture in the 19th century, the similarity between cinema and the social world makes cinema more effective than other forms of art in order to make social realities visible. This new motion picture camera is expected to cover the political stance. This is the main reason I choosed this film from the syllabus, since it boldly showed what was neglected but had to be talked about. I admired the processing of the subject mentioned in the movie. In this way, I was able to go deeply into the topics that I will talk about below, which I can interpret cursely, but with this film I can shape the concept of rebelliousness. It has successfully fulfilled the expectation of "new point of view and new knowledge" that I expected from the cinema.

La Haine is dedicated to those who died during its construction, with real images in the opening sequence. Therefore, from the moment we go to the screen, it is not possible to stand out from the feeling that we are talking about an event that happened with the storyteller. I think we can better understand the film's convey to the story by examining the movie La Haine through suburban culture and ethnic antagonism.

“The story of the man who fell from the 50 storey building. He repeats the following to relieve himself on every floor: So far everything is fine, so far everything is fine. What matters is not the fall but the ground.” The opening sequence, accompanied by police violence, actions, banners and real images of flaming vehicles, and Bob Marley's Burning and Looting song, is connected with a news about the rising rebellion in the suburbs as the health condition of Abdel Ichaha, beaten during the interrogation, has become critical. The film builds its tension through the disappearing police weapon and Abdel's critical health condition.

Minorities that are marginalized through stereotypes turn into scapegoats, which are easy targets of all kinds of oppression since they are different and relatively weak. The film defines the oppression as a systematic and institutionalized act of maltreatment. The suburbs, where minority ethnic groups and the poor are left to live and turned into a closed box by making it difficult to reach the city centers, also brings many class and ethnic based uprisings behind.

When the loss of the police weapon is mentioned again, people say that the person who finds it burns Paris and something changes. The gun, which is found by Vinz, both creates problems and solves their problems throughout the movie. Çehov's weapon principle keeps tension alive by the fact that the weapon could explode at any time. In contrast to this "Burning Paris" idea, we listen to the story of an old man they met at the center. In the story, the advice of the old man to the three young people, in my opinion quite implicitly; When Vinz killed a police officer, he would avenge what the state had done to him so far. As relaxing as the toilet. But while the truth of state was clearly visible, the reasons, intentions, and past would not be looked at, and the shield train would not stop for Vinz.

It is debated whether it is necessary or reasonable to kill the police for a long time between Vinz, Hubert and Said. After these conversations, the news of the death of Abdel is reflected on their faces in the form of learned helplessness, like an expected end. Vinz dreams that he aimed at a police officer with his hand and shot him. Vinz also talks about a cow he saw in the suburb from time to time at the beginning of the movie. This convinces the audience that Vinz is disconnected from reality. In addition, we follow Hubert as logical and consistent, and Said as variable.

When Hubert and Said fall into the hands of a racist group, Vinz saves their lives for the second time with that weapon. When Vinz rests a gun on one of the racist gang members, Hubert says, "There are also good cops, but the best skinhead is dead," and tells him to shoot him. "Racism is not an ideological thought, but rather a psychological disease." says Malcolm X. The state can somehow put forward the police to organize the society and control the events. What is dangerous is the racist discourses within the state policies and the law enforcement forces that hold the power of the state personalize this hatred. In this scene, with Hubert's guidance, we see that the ideology that needs to be protested may have to change.

Hate is a multi-dimensional, very strong and easily shaped feeling. This emotion, which determines the direction of many social relations and mechanisms, creates its character and possesses a great power of change, has a structure that can even produce positive results under control. Hate has always been at the heart of the great transformations experienced with its social dimension rather than its individual dimension. The movements that set out with a wrong consciousness are easily controlled by the power they resist and often give the public the impression that the desired is achieved. But what happens is only the changed hands of domination. The system continues to operate on the same dynamics, but with a different image. Facing a mistake makes no sense unless you destroy it and replace it with the truth, that is, if you cannot create your own solution.

The desperation caused by the lack of solution forces young people like Vinz and Hubert to deny this feeling in various ways. Hate feeling intertwines with other feelings that are close to it and creates many subcultures. The poor and oppressed young people of the big cities try to suppress and destroy the natural hatred and anger that created them by enjoying pain and sorrow.

In the words of Albert Camus, “The slave starts with wanting justice, and ends with asking for a kingdom. Now he must be sovereign.”[1]. Responding to the opposed power with pure hatred will eventually end up in a vicious circle of positive social changes that may occur. If this social hatred as a social power cannot be transformed into a comprehensive and unconditional love, the only thing that remains is the image. The angry youth of the previous order turns into a new dominant force and in turn creates a new angry youth. Unless there is a comprehensive transformation that will break this vicious circle, all solutions will remain temporary, local and groundless. Regardless of the correct foundation built to replace the wrong system, it will create its own oppressors and oppressed over time.

La Haine is a reflection of a universal reality, independent of time and space. It is the story of angry humanity living all over the world; excluded and oppressed young people. That is why it provided me with new ways of seeing and especially thinking about the World. It shows that history is a total of revolts, but the successes achieved as a result are open to debate. The director naturally conveyed this class case and hate issue, which is depressing and which people often ignore. With the film, we follow the internal motivations of the rebels in their own lives rather than following the emergence and progress of the rebellion. I think that this kind of narration reinforces and reflects the reality of what happened and what will happen. Witnessing the collective actions actually consist of separate individuals, gives events a much more visionary perspective. Because, although it seems that there are two main ideas in system-public conflicts, the people unite with different ideas within the framework of the common difficulties that the system imposes on them.

In addition, powerful aspects were scrolls, handheld camera, dolly, mirror scene, ever-changing zooms and camera heights which were able to become a kind of reflection of the free spirits of those young men, as the viewfinder roam freely in both indoor and outdoor areas. Even when watching separate sections, we have the chance to catch the magic of cinema with these effects.
