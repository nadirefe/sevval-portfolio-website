## **Comparement of "Do the Right Thing" and "Night on Earth" (New York episode) in terms of the cinematic style that they employ and in terms of their representation of Brooklyn.**

Dualist thinking is the basis for Lee's storytelling style. Two hands constantly fighting; love and hate, peace and violence. The ideological and methodological differences of the two heroes of the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, lie behind this mentality. Martin Luther King Jr. has a Gandhi-esque ideology, suggesting that the movement can only succeed through peaceful protests and methods, while Malcolm X argues that violence and militants should be used where it is necessary. These two different ways of thinking pushed all Black Americans, including Lee, to an ideological paradox, blurring what was right. Spike Lee addresses this paradox in the movie Do the Right Thing. While symbolizing what these two different political views mean for the neighborhood, it reflects the social boiling dynamically and harmoniously to its audience through “tracking shots”.

Spike Lee also used the Brecht theater in his film. Normally, there is no narrator on stage in the modern theater. Instead, his voice is heard. In other words, the story or the message to be given is always given from behind, by people we do not see. At the Brecht theater, however, the narrator is right in the middle of the scene. This is the first time that the "defamiliarization" that Brecht wants to create is realized. In the film, this example corresponds to Mister Senor Love Daddy. He stands in the middle of the neighborhood and knows what everyone is doing, tells stories. Another Brecht effect is "breaking the fourth wall", which is manifested as speaking with the audience on stage. In the film, the scenes that the actors count and cast into nationalities by looking at the camera, and at the same time, the scene in which Raheem tells about love and hate corresponds to this technique.

Another remarkable technique in the film is the Dutch angle. This technique ensures that characters and action are framed at an unbalanced angle. This distortion can also be done by tilting the embankment and the landscape. In this way, the emotional effect desired to be felt to the audience is increased and the representation is avoided. The movie "Do the Right Thing" represents both realism and expressionism at the same time. "Dutch Angle" was specially manipulated to convey the theme of the movie, to emphasize the racial tension between the characters.

In the shooting of the film, the viewing angles of the characters were also taken into account, like Mother Sister sitting at the window, shot from below. The shooting of Radio Raheem, which has a large and aggressive image, with inclined angles, allows us to predict the future violence. The reason for watching the debate between Sal and Radio Raheem with inverted, bent and fast camera angles is to reflect the tension and anger between them. The most important cinematographic features of this film were camera angles. Apart from these, the scenes take place within a very small part of the neighborhood.

In the New York episode of the second film, Night on Earth, the film is mostly watched inside and outside the "main character" taxi. The entrance section shows still pictures taken from New York with light, classical entrance music. When the story begins, we watch the character dressed in a remarkable outfit while waiting for a taxi. When he gets in a taxi, we watch the dialogues between the driver and the customer. The processes of getting to know each other, their conversations and reactions are fully observed. On the way, the camera takes the glittering streets of New York in sync with a taxi. When the characters begin to get to know each other, New York's alleys are followed through the taxi, again through the eyes of the characters. The Night on Earth movie, based on the dialogue, was designed to give the feeling that we are in the taxi. The camera is always stationary, the only thing that moves is the vehicle we are in. The scenes seen outside the vehicle are not arranged as a set, as it is, there are cross sections of the city.

Unlike the first film, Night on Earth is a movie that is based on people, not an event, and exhibits an instant situation. Since the content shows a natural memory, there is nothing played in the camera settings. However, since the characters and their events are followed in the first movie, the audience is directed by cinematography.

In Do the Right Thing, we watch Brooklyn, NY based on a single neighborhood. The
movie was shot without going out of a single street. On this street, we have houses
and the most important place, Sal's pizza shop, where we can observe all the characters.
In the film, Brooklyn is clearly reflected as a black neighborhood. We can easily
understand this from their attitude to the almost one white man, sportsman, in the
neighborhood. Apart from the black people, the only ones that can hold on to this
neighborhood are the Asian family and the Italian family with their own shops. The
lively, metropolitan city image that comes to mind when New York is mentioned is
not valid in this neighborhood. The director wanted to explain the Brooklyn presentation
through characters rather than space. Even if there are ethnic blacks predominant
in this neighborhood, those who are more economically independent are those who are
"white" and "Asian". Although their daily lives do not contain much violence, there
is a passive aggressive conflict between origins in this neighborhood. For this reason,
Brooklyn, where the film takes place, has been portrayed as the living space of a
community where racism is clearly embraced by both the public and the police, but
not sure how to integrate it into their lives.

In the movie Night on Earth, there is a presence that reflects the truth as it is on New York, and which does not aim to give a new perspective. As the venue here, New York does not contain any social content, we do not see the lives of people in the city. The functioning of the place here consists of the journey of two main characters. First of all, it passes through the most famous streets of New York, the roads that everyone knows and admires in general. Both main characters agree that this is a very "cool" place. As the taxi progresses, you enter Brooklyn, where Yoyo lives. This place is more idiosyncratic than the original places. It passes through a neighborhood that is not very bright in New York. Yoyo describes this place as his home. However, this film also shows that the black character in the center of New York is not taken into a lot of taxis because he is black, with no emphasis. This situation is not discussed in the movie. Because, as it said, this is a usual, accepted natural situation in New York and many other places. The movie does not claim anything on this subject. A spontaneous section in New York is portrayed. The characters have no criticism of the city's structure either. The city is only visually passed through. It is clear that Brooklyn is a separate neighborhood in New York. We also watch the dazzling Times square and Manhattan bridge for someone who has just arrived, as well as the suburbs neighborhood where someone living there can feel.
