## Opening Sequence Project

**Otto e Mezzo by FEDERICO FELLINI**

8½ is a very realistic reflection of Federico Fellini's own life. The movie opens with a dream scene. The opening sequence is also making its mark as one of the best opening sequences in the history of cinema.

For this reason, I wanted to prepare the title sequence of this film, which is basically autobiographical, but where dream and reality are intertwined with surrealism, by mixing vectors and photographs.

Federico Fellini reflected the harmony of fiction with the fantasy world using the Italian neorealism. This film by Fellini, while affecting the language of the street and the flowing lives of ordinary people, on the other hand, created a different world with the possibilities of surrealism.

With this title sequence, I want to give the audience the foresight that they will watch a movie moving in spiral time. The first reaction I expect to see in the audience is that they have watched a visual feast full of dreams. But besides the visuality, I expect them to have a personal experience with the ambiguity of the concept of time.

Also, the movie is very strong musically. For this reason, I will use one of the compositions of Nino Rota, who made the soundtrack for the sound design.
