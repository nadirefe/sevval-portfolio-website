## Sculpture Project

This project includes different disciplines: An installation that includes sculpting from mud, plastic coating and circuit making. The standard female face model I made from mud is a symbol of the belief that humankind was created from mud. I aim to show the most natural and pure state of human beings with the sculpture I made. 

The mask that covers the outside consists of surgical masks that have entered our literature rapidly in recent years. This image exaggerates the image of a woman whose face is covered with a surgical bandage. 

The circuit that illuminates the statue was set up by me and positioned to illuminate the mask from different angles.

With this installation, I want to draw attention to the pressure of beauty on women. Uniformity under the name of beautification is one of the most important problems affecting the psyche of women. While we try to conform to the stereotypical beauty standards as we think, we lose our own spirit and forget that we have different beauties under different lights.
