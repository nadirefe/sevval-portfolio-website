People tend to categorize both in daily life practices and mental activities. The reason for this is the desire to simplify and make sense of everything abstract or concrete.

There is a tendency to make some judgment about other people, even when they have just a few pieces of information. Since assessment is the most important dimension in human perception, we tend to categorize people as good or bad, not both good and bad. Then we can continue to perceive other features in accordance with this basic assessment.

Human is always in change. This change brings with it the difficulty of perception, on the other hand, it causes every evaluation made about it to be voided after a certain period of time.

One of the most basic ways to categorize people is by labeling them according to their appearance. It is the most applied form of labeling in the world.

Unfortunately, an inhuman evaluation like this is the most common form of labeling we encounter. This movement, which is made without listening to people, without taking a holistic approach as a human being, without thinking above all within the framework of respect, is the main reason for conflict, separation and alienation within the society.

In this project, I will handle the discrimination theme in a stop motion animation. The script of the short film consists of the concept of "labeling people" symbolically.
