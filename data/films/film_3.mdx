## Figure of the flâneuse in "Cleo from 5 to 7" and "Faces Places" and their cinematic styles

In the movie "Cleo from 5 to 7", the first flaneuse we come across is Cleo. We see Cleo walking vitally and dynamically in the streets of the city, among people, trees and flowers, bicycles, cars and buses, dogs and pigeons, shops and cafes. The director focused on the city as well as on Cleo. Looking at how Director Agnes Varda looks at Paris and learning to look at Cleo, it's an experience both in terms of viewing the city and watching the film. What makes Cleo's walk so traceable is the transformation of her interaction with the city. In addition, a flanuer would touch this process. The idea of ​​transformation is brought up by a tarot reader while seeking assurance that a disease, that Cleo visits on the opening stage, will not prove fatal. The fortune teller cannot give her this assurance; however, the prophecy of Cleo's "deep transformation of her being" becomes the focus of the movie. Thus, Cleo, who was initially blinded to the city environment with her so intertwined and fetish image, learns to open her eyes slowly and allows what she sees to transform her.

Striking artificiality and structure of Cleo's appearance; blonde wig, elaborate make-up, and flamboyant high-heeled shoes raise questions about why she presents herself this way. There are two other flaneuses that have a place in the formation of this process. First one is the taxi driver woman. This woman is much more solid and confident than the main character. Being a flaneuse in the city is her own choice, she does not have a need to prove herself. The last flaneuse is Cleo's friend who is a model for art students. This character clearly distinguishes with Cleo on the topic: seeing and being seen. Although act of seeing defined as masculine act, model thinks that her body is an idea for students, not victimizing herself.

Varda gives the impression of walking with flâneuses in her films; this creates realism and overt stylization styles. Unlike this time, we watch Varda directly and walk with her. Throughout the Faces Places, Varda is in a mood that reflects herself, as in all documentary films. In this reflection, the young photographer JR accompanying her also has a big impact. In addition to reflecting herself, she expands her mind as a collector who collects pieces from her past to create new art.

As she has done throughout her career, Varda allows her content to speak. She also leaves a role for her guests to explain what her film will, can be about. The questions we will ask are directed to Varda in the film. The fact that this is a discovery film and the Varda herself is a flaneuse shows that the innovation and learning process will be dominant. They always go to villages, simple landscapes, faces. Just like Cleo, she still travels outside, forcing us to examine how we see the World and ourselves.

For Varda and JR, meaning of producing images are rememberance, memory and mortality. They find things which are thrown away and collect them. Varda also create a dimension of mortality with her feet on train. This was an objectification with humorous fit, creating a whole new meaning where there is no relation with patriarchy. Materiality of body is reflected spiritual in this case. "My greatest desire," Varda tells JR, "is to meet new faces and photograph them so they don’t fall down the holes in my memory."

Varda describes JR's murals as “living, breathing, talking with walls inside, crying, humming the walls”. For Varda, the walls are seen as facilitators rather than barriers to communication. This may indicate why Varda made her experimental breakthrough and discovery in this style.

"Cleo from 5 to 7", written and directed by Agnes Varda, is a series of techniques,
including transition from color to black and white and occasional voice over attachments.
The black-and-white film begins with tarot cards, a monochrome shooting scene. The
speeches of the fortune teller and Cleo are heard in this scene, taken from the top
of the table of a fortuneteller where two pairs of hands are moved. Agnes Varda shows
Cleo and fortune teller in close-up transitions during the fortune telling. These
scenes, where we see the characters for the first time, and the rest of the movie
are shot in black and white. Intensive and striking patterns are seen in the entrance
sequence.

We begin to watch Cléo, who suspects that she has cancer and has two hours to learn, while escaping death on the streets of Paris. We see the signs of cancer in the tarot cards, but the character, who tries to comfort herself by thinking that the beauty will not die, increases the belief in death by seeing death with a glass broken on the streets of Paris. Here, the transitions of beauty and death between mirror and glass are among the most obvious images. Another visualization that the director presses is the time. At this point, the concept of the French philosopher Henri Bergson, which inspired the French New Wave movement, can be seen as 'duration'. The heterogeneous time conceived as real time is concrete time. Homogeneous time is a symbolic expression of real time. According to Bergson, the hour invented by science only measures the time in space, whereas the real time is the constant addition of the past to the present moment. Varda homogenizes the concept of "5 to 7", which gives the movie its name, by making the film an hour and a half. Also, we saw a scene three times which is Cleo's profile. This also shows the time is extended.

The film is based on episodic structure. We experience all these episodes both by watching Cleo from the outside and by watching with Cleo. The movie continues with the camera following Cleo. In the taxi scene, the camera shows both Cleo and anxious mood, and the path that the vehicle takes from Cleo's eyes.

The close-ups used in the beginning are replaced by remote and wide shots where we can follow every step in Paris spatially. All the details of the interior, sculpture studio and Cleo's room, are shown in the film in detail. Every material used and shown occupies a place in Cleo's character introduction and development. Apart from this, we have traveled from Paris almost completely. In every scene, Cleo has a remarkable position in the scenario, even though it plays the leading role with her eye-catching makeup and dresses. There is a more natural composition in "inner journey" after the edits in the opening sequence.

The film also hosts a short-silent film. We are watching Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina together. Respect for other works that were not observed in previous films is beginning to show itself clearly with the new wave. It can seen the poster of the movie "Un Chien Andalou-An Andalusian Dog" within a short moment.

In Faces Places, Varda and JR travel around France in a van which set up with a photo booth and large formar printer. They stop by towns and villages to meet and photograph the people living there. The primary observations about the subject and its cinematic style are the sense of calm, no ambiguity and clarity of observations. Colors and spaces create a sense of playful feeling. Dialogues, journeys and destinations are always cheerful and colorful. Although this travel movie is in the concept of documentary taken with digital camera, it is also intertwined with cinema and photography. Fictional meeting scenarios were written in the opening section, hypothetical false encounters are depicted.

It is also possible to call the documentary self-reflexive. A self-reflexive movie is a movie that notifies the viewer of the movie making process. Reflexing is achieved by looking at the cameras, taking advantage of the fact that the screen is two-dimensional, and making a movie about making movies.

The documentary manages to draw a realistic portrait of France by sticking huge human portraits to high buildings and walls. For this reason, we see wide angle camera uses and fixed or moving cameras that monitor the directors. Although it does not contain shooting games, the movie is always in motion with the use of more space. The camera takes all the artists and visitors into its frame.

The use of voiceover plays an important role in Faces Places, which it uses to create stories and characters. For example, in a scene where Varda and JR bring together a group of locals to decorate an abandoned seaside resort, Varda uses voiceover to imagine that the buildings are still in the settlement while telling the images. This technique is used to create a narrative from an archive image or to interpret a series of photos.

There is a warmth and playful indirectness in this trial road movie in the classic nouvelle vague spirit, creating a semi-accidental narrative in the middle of what is apparently a documentary.

In Cleo from 5 to 7, we were watching the character, wondering and following it. At Faces Places, we also experience an experimental process.
